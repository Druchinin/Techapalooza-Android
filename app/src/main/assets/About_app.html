	<h1>About The App</h1>
	<p>The Techapalooza Mobile App was built to "bring technology to a technology event." As the #1 local event bringing the tech-community together, we felt that the clever use of software would eliminate some event-based pain points (ex. printing paper tickets) and add to the overall spirit of the event. We spent the past 4 months working with the Techapalooza Team to define their unique needs, create a project blue-print, design the user-friendly interface and develop the platform-specific code.</p>
 
	<p>The result of this team-effort includes 2 custom mobile apps. The iOS & Android Apps let users scroll through the event newsfeed, review the schedule, purchase and store tickets, study the band line-up, and review venue details. Using tickets stored within the app, users can 'scan' into the building, vote for their favorite band, and avoid massive printer-jams leaving the house that morning.</p>
 
	<p>And the iOS & Android Apps aren't all we built! We added website payments for those not using the mobile apps, an entrance scanning-app to read your tickets at the door, a voting-app for selecting your favorite band, and an administrative tool for the organizers to manage all the Techa-nology from a single screen. Pretty cool, huh?!</p>
